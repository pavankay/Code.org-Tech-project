                    <h2>Sea-Tac</h2>
                    <p>Our journey started where most journeys in Seattle start, Seattle-Tacoma Airport. Here is where we took a Boeing 737-900 MAX (dont ask me how I know) to San Francisco International Airport, then a bus to our hotel in Monterey Bay, California. On the way we stopped at San Pedro Square Market from lunch, and then finished the drive to the hotel. We settled in to the hotel and then went our separate ways to dinner.</p>

                    <p>After we dropped of our stuff at the hotel we walked to a kayaking place. On the way we saw Sea Lions on the rocks. We also saw them while kayaking. When I went kayaking, a couple of sea lions chased us becaused we went to close to their territory. After we got back to the hotel and changed, three groups split for dinner</p>
