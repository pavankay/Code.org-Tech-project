        <h1>Welcome to Our Monterey Bay Journey</h1>
        <p class="intro-text">
            This year, our 6th-grade trip took us to Monterey Bay, California. The trip, on the educational side, was about the people who used to live there and their history. We mainly focused on the Chinese fishing village, the Rumsen Ohlone, and the Mexican farmworkers. We also learned independence since we had to wake up every day, go to breakfast by ourselves, and meet for dinner on our own. All in all, the trip was an amazing experience.
